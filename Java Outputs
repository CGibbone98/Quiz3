class GfG 
{ 
    public static void main(String args[]) 
    { 
        String s1 = new String("geeksforgeeks"); 
        String s2 = new String("geeksforgeeks"); 
        if (s1 == s2)  
            System.out.println("Equal"); 
        else
            System.out.println("Not equal"); 
    } 
} 

Output is 'Not Equal"

I was confused by this in Java Outputs Set 8. The problem is that 
"s1 and s2 are two different objects the references are not the same, and the == operator compares object reference. 
So it prints “Not equal”, to compare the actual characters in the string .equals() method must be used."

I understand why it won't work now, but only after reading through that sentence multiple times. I did not understand it and got lost
there simply because either my memory totally failed me or we did not go over this in my Introduction to Java Programming Class.
